# project-readable

This is an app that allows users to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users will also be able to edit and delete posts and comments.


## Prerequisites

You'll need to install Node.js and npm first.
[`Node + npm`](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Installation
1. Clone this Repo
`git clone https://github.com/lookshinji/project_readable.git Readable`
The Readable name is optional. You can change the directory name.

2. After cloning this repository, go inside the directory
`cd Readable`
Or cd **directory_name** you've chosen.

3. Inside Readable, first we'll start the app itself
`cd frontend`

4. Once inside the frontend directory install all the dependencies with
`npm install`

5. After you have installed all the dependencies you just need to start the app
`npm start`

The App should be running in **`localhost:3000`**

**Then you have to start the server**

6. On another terminal session, inside **Readable**, go to the API folder
`cd api-server`
Or ../api-server if you're on 'frontend'

7. After you have installed all the dependencies you just need to start the app
`npm start`
